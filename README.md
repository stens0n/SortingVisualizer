Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Visualization: My Algorithm Visualizer

An Algorithm Visualizer created with React. As of now, it brings Quick Sort and Merge Sort to life, with plans to incorporate more sorting algorithms progressively.

This endeavor has not only allowed me to delve deeper into algorithms but also presented a unique learning avenue on the frontend.

Here are some insights gained along the way:

-Performance Optimizations: Balancing between performance and visualization, ensuring smooth animations without compromising algorithm efficiency.
-Responsive Design: Tailoring the visualizer for different screen sizes has enhanced my grasp of responsive design.
-Color Coding for Clarification: Utilizing color changes to signify different stages in the sorting process.
-Recursive Problem Solving: Implementing Merge Sort and Quick Sort demonstrated the principle of recursion. It showed me how complex problems can be broken down into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.
